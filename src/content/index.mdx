# Neural Magic Documentation

Neural Magic‚Äôs Deep Sparse Platform provides a suite of software components to train and deploy sparsified deep learning models performantly on your data.
The [DeepSparse Engine](/products/deepsparse) enables GPU-class performance on CPUs for neural network deployments.
[SparseML](/products/sparseml) leverages [recipes](/user-guide/what-are-recipes) to allow simple model [sparsification](/user-guide/what-is-sparsification) with only a few lines of code.
And the [SparseZoo](/products/sparsezoo) stores presparsified models and sparsification recipes so you can easily plugin your data.
