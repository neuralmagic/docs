# Neural Magic Documentation

Neural Magic's Deep Sparse Platform provides models and tools needed to create sparse models and a CPU-based inference engine that runs sparse models at GPU speeds.

Using the DeepSparse platform, you are free to deploy your neural networks anywhere you have a CPU from edge to cloud.
  
There are three libraries which accomplish these goals:

- [DeepSparse Engine](/products/deepsparse) offers best-in-class CPU performance for dense and sparsified models.
Specifically for sparse models, it offers better than GPU performance in many use cases.
The performance is achieved by leveraging technology around the unique cache hierarchy of CPUs for faster memory access, and sparsification techniques to reduce the number of FLOPs.

- [SparseML](/products/sparseml) provides the tools to easily create sparse models via [sparse transfer-learning](/get-started/transfer-a-sparsified-model) from pre-sparsified models or state-of-the-art [sparsification algorithms](/user-guide/sparsification) that prune dense models from scratch.
The algorithms are built on top of recipes that encode configurations and hyperparamers, enabling easy integration to common frameworks with only a few lines of code.

- [SparseZoo](/products/sparsezoo) stores dense and presparsified models/recipes ready for deployment, sparsification, and fine-tuning onto your data.
SparseZoo stubs enable you to reference any model on the SparseZoo in a convenient and identifiable way.
They are found throughout the documentation and the model pages on the [SparseZoo website](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com).
