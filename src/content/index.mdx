# Neural Magic Documentation

Welcome to software-delivered AI... Welcome to Neural Magic! We enable you to deploy deep learning models on commodity CPUs with GPU-class performance.

Through our guided experiences and documentation, you can discover how to unlock the full potential of your ML environment and accommodate the continuous growth of neural networks without adding complexity or cost.

You can integrate ML into your application quickly using DeepSparse, which is an inference runtime offering GPU class performance on CPUs and APIs for the fastest AI performance. First, select a model to deploy, which can be your own model in ONNX format or a model from Neural Magic’s SparseZoo&mdash;an open-source repository for sparse and sparse-quantized models. Then, use DeepSparse to benchmark, evaluate, and inference.

Alternatively, you can sparsify your selected model before deploying to DeepSparse. Sparsification is accomplished with Neural Magic’s Sparsify&mdash;an ML optimization product to accelerate inference at scale&mdash;or SparseML&mdash;an open-source sparsification research framework. Once your model is optimized, use DeepSparse to benchmark, evaluate, and inference. Because DeepSparse reaches GPU-class performance with commodity CPUs, you do not need to tether deployments to accelerators in order to reach the performance needed for production.

This was a quick look at Neural Magic’s suite of products. Now, we invite you to explore our products through guided experiences and documentation.
