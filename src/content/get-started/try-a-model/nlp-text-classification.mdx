# Try a Text Classification Model

This page explains how to run a trained model with the DeepSparse Engine for NLP inside a Python API called `Pipelines.`

`Pipelines` wraps key utilities around DeepSparse for easy testing and deployment.

The text classification `Pipeline`, for example, wraps an NLP model with the proper pre-processing and post-processing pipelines, such as tokenization.
This enables passing in raw text sequences and receiving the labeled predictions from DeepSparse without any extra effort.
With all of this built on top of DeepSparse, the simplicity of `Pipelines` is combined with GPU-class performance on CPUs for sparse models.

## Installation Requirements

This example requires [DeepSparse General Installation](/get-started/install/deepsparse).

## Model Setup

The first step is collecting an ONNX representaiton of the model and required configuration files.
The text classification `Pipeline` is integrated with Hugging Face and uses Hugging Face's standards
and configurations for model setup. The following files are required:
- `model.onnx` - Exported Transformers model in the ONNX format.
- `tokenizer.json` - Hugging Face tokenizer used with the model.
- `tokenizer_config.json` - Hugging Face tokenizer configuration used with the model.
- `config.json` - Hugging Face configuration file used with the model.

For an example of the configuration files, check out [BERT's model page on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased/tree/main).

There are two options for passing these files to DeepSparse:

<details>

  <summary><b>1) Using SparseZoo stubs (recommended starting point)</b></summary>

SparseZoo contains several pre-sparsified Transformer models, including the configuration files listed above. DeepSparse is integrated
with SparseZoo, and supports SparseZoo stubs as inputs for automatic download and inclusion into easy testing and deployment.

The SparseZoo stubs can be found on SparseZoo model pages, and DistilBERT examples are provided below:
- [Sparse-quantized DistilBERT](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/models/nlp%2Ftext_classification%2Fdistilbert-none%2Fpytorch%2Fhuggingface%2Fmnli%2Fpruned80_quant-none-vnni)
```bash
zoo:nlp/text_classification/distilbert-none/pytorch/huggingface/mnli/pruned80_quant-none-vnni
  ```
- [Dense DistilBERT](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/models/nlp%2Ftext_classification%2Fdistilbert-none%2Fpytorch%2Fhuggingface%2Fmnli%2Fbase-none)
```bash
zoo:nlp/text_classification/distilbert-none/pytorch/huggingface/mnli/base-none
  ```

These SparseZoo stubs are passed arguments to the `Pipeline` constructor in the examples below.

<summary><b>2) Using a local model</b></summary>

Alternatively, you can use a custom or fine-tuned model from your local drive.

There are three steps to using a local model with `Pipelines`:

1. Export the model to `model.onnx` (if you trained with SparseML, use [ONNX export](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml/tree/main/integrations/huggingface-transformers#exporting-to-onnx)).
2. Collect the configuration files listed above. These are generally stored with the resulting model files from Hugging Face training pipelines (as is the case with SparseML).
3. Place the files into a directory.

Pass the path of the local directory in the `--model_path` in place of the SparseZoo stubs in the examples below.

</details>

## Inference Pipelines

With the text classification model set up, the model can be passed into a DeepSparse `Pipeline` utilizing the `model_path` argument.
The SparseZoo stub for the sparse-quantized DistilBERT model given at the beginning is used in the sample code below.
The `Pipeline` automatically downloads the necessary files for the model from the SparseZoo and compiles them on your local machine in DeepSparse.
Once compiled, the model `Pipeline` is ready for inference with text sequences.

```python
from deepsparse import Pipeline

classification_pipeline = Pipeline.create(
    task="text-classification",
    model_path="zoo:nlp/text_classification/distilbert-none/pytorch/huggingface/mnli/pruned80_quant-none-vnni",
)
inference = classification_pipeline(
    [[
        "Fun for adults and children.",
        "Fun for only children.",
    ]]
)
print(inference)

> labels=['contradiction'] scores=[0.9983579516410828]
```

Because DistilBERT is a language model trained on the MNLI dataset, it can additionally be used to perform zero-shot text classification for any text sequences.
The code below gives an example of a zero-shot text classification pipeline.

```python
from deepsparse import Pipeline

zero_shot_pipeline = Pipeline.create(
    task="zero_shot_text_classification",
    model_path="zoo:nlp/text_classification/distilbert-none/pytorch/huggingface/mnli/pruned80_quant-none-vnni",
    model_scheme="mnli",
    model_config={"hypothesis_template": "This text is related to {}"},
)
inference = zero_shot_pipeline(
    sequences='Who are you voting for in 2020?',
    labels=['politics', 'public health', 'Europe'],
)
print(inference)

> sequences='Who are you voting for in 2020?' labels=['politics', 'Europe', 'public health'] scores=[0.9345628619194031, 0.039115309715270996, 0.026321841403841972]
```

## Benchmarking

The DeepSparse installation includes a benchmark CLI for convenient and easy inference benchmarking: `deepsparse.benchmark`.
The CLI takes in either a SparseZoo stub or a path to a local `model.onnx` file.

### Dense DistilBERT

The code below provides an example for benchmarking a dense DistilBERT model in the DeepSparse Engine.
The output shows that the model achieved 32.6 items per second on a 4-core CPU.

```bash
$ deepsparse.benchmark zoo:nlp/text_classification/distilbert-none/pytorch/huggingface/mnli/base-none

### Sparsified DistilBERT
