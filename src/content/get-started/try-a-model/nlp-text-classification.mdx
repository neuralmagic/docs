# Try a Text Classification Model

This page explains how to run a trained model with the DeepSparse Engine for NLP inside a Python API called `Pipelines.`

`Pipelines` wrap key utilities around the DeepSparse Engine for easy testing and deployment.

The text classification `Pipeline`, for example, wraps an NLP model with the proper preprocessing and postprocessing pipelines, such as tokenization.
This enables passing in raw text sequences and receiving the labeled predictions from the DeepSparse Engine without any extra effort.
With all of this built on top of the DeepSparse Engine, the simplicity of `Pipelines` is combined with GPU-class performance on CPUs for sparse models.

## Install Requirements

This example requires [DeepSparse General Install](/get-started/install/deepsparse).

## Model Setup

The first step is collecting an ONNX representaiton of the model and required configuration files. 
The text classification `Pipeline` is integrated with HuggingFace and uses HuggingFace's standards 
and configurations for model setup. The following files are required:
- `model.onnx` - The exported Transformers model in the ONNX format.
- `tokenizer.json` - The HuggingFace tokenizer used with the model.
- `tokenizer_config.json` - The HuggingFace tokenizer configuration used with the model.
- `config.json` - The HuggingFace configuration file used with the model.

For an example of the config files, checkout [BERT's model page on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased/tree/main).

There are two options for passing these files to DeepSparse:

<details>

<summary><b>1) Using SparseZoo Stubs (Reccomended Starting Point)</b></summary>

SparseZoo contains several pre-sparsified Transformer models, including the config files listed above. DeepSparse is integrated
with SparseZoo, and supports SparseZoo stubs as inputs for automatic download and inclusion into easy testing and deployment.

The SparseZoo stubs can be found on SparseZoo model pages, and DistilBERT examples are provided below:
- [Sparse-quantized DistilBERT](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/models/nlp%2Ftext_classification%2Fdistilbert-none%2Fpytorch%2Fhuggingface%2Fmnli%2Fpruned80_quant-none-vnni)
```bash
zoo:nlp/text_classification/distilbert-none/pytorch/huggingface/mnli/pruned80_quant-none-vnni
  ```
- [Dense DistilBERT](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/models/nlp%2Ftext_classification%2Fdistilbert-none%2Fpytorch%2Fhuggingface%2Fmnli%2Fbase-none)
```bash
zoo:nlp/text_classification/distilbert-none/pytorch/huggingface/mnli/base-none
  ```

These SparseZoo stubs are passed arguments to the `Pipeline` constructor in the examples below.

<summary><b>2) Using a Local Model</b></summary>

Alternatively, you can use a custom or fine-tuned model from your local drive.

There are three steps to using a local model with `Pipelines`:

1. Export model to `model.onnx` (if you trained with SparseML, use [ONNX export](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml/tree/main/integrations/huggingface-transformers#exporting-to-onnx))
2. Collect the configuration files listed above. These are generally stored with the resulting model files from HuggingFace training pipelines (as is the case with SparseML)
3. Place the files into a directory

Pass the path the local directory in the `--model_path` in place of the SparseZoo stubs in the examples below.

</details>

## Inference Pipelines

With the text classification model setup, it can then be passed into a DeepSparse `Pipeline` utilizing the `model_path` argument.
The SparseZoo stub for the sparse-quantized DistilBERT model given at the beginning is used in the sample code below.
The `Pipeline` automatically downloads the necessary files for the model from the SparseZoo and compiles them on your local machine in the DeepSparse engine.
Once compiled, the model `Pipeline` is ready for inference with text sequences.

```python
from deepsparse import Pipeline

classification_pipeline = Pipeline.create(
    task="text-classification",
    model_path="zoo:nlp/text_classification/distilbert-none/pytorch/huggingface/mnli/pruned80_quant-none-vnni",
)
inference = classification_pipeline(
    [[
        "Fun for adults and children.",
        "Fun for only children.",
    ]]
)
print(inference)

> labels=['contradiction'] scores=[0.9983579516410828]
```

Because DistilBERT is a language model trained on the MNLI dataset, it can additionally be used to perform zero-shot text classification for any text sequences.
The code below gives an example of a zero-shot text classification pipeline.

```python
from deepsparse import Pipeline

zero_shot_pipeline = Pipeline.create(
    task="zero_shot_text_classification",
    model_path="zoo:nlp/text_classification/distilbert-none/pytorch/huggingface/mnli/pruned80_quant-none-vnni",
    model_scheme="mnli",
    model_config={"hypothesis_template": "This text is related to {}"},
)
inference = zero_shot_pipeline(
    sequences='Who are you voting for in 2020?',
    labels=['politics', 'public health', 'Europe'],
)
print(inference)

> sequences='Who are you voting for in 2020?' labels=['politics', 'Europe', 'public health'] scores=[0.9345628619194031, 0.039115309715270996, 0.026321841403841972]
```

## Benchmarking

The DeepSparse install includes a benchmark CLI for convenient and easy inference benchmarking: `deepsparse.benchmark`.
The CLI takes in either a SparseZoo stub or a path to a local `model.onnx` file.

### Dense DistilBERT

The code below provides an example for benchmarking a dense DistilBERT model in the DeepSparse Engine.
The output shows that the model achieved 32.6 items per second on a 4-core CPU.

```bash
$ deepsparse.benchmark zoo:nlp/text_classification/distilbert-none/pytorch/huggingface/mnli/base-none

### Sparsified DistilBERT

It achieved 221.0 items per second, a **6.8X increase** in performance over the dense baseline.
