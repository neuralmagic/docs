# Transfer a Sparse Model

[Sparse transfer learning](../../user-guide/sparsification/transfer-learning) enables an easy pathway for creating performant models trained on your datasets.
Like with dense transfer learning, sparse transfer learning works by creating a general architecture on a large dataset and then finetuning onto another, downstream dataset.
This process enables smaller models that can be deployed for cheaper and faster inferences without worrying about the hyperparameters involved in [sparsification techniques](../../user-guide/sparsification).
Sparse transfer learning is faster than [sparsifying your own model](../sparsify-your-model), but may not work as well when the original, upstream dataset or training scheme deviates significantly from the downstream.
The [DeepSparse Engine](../../products/deepsparse), for example, can then use the sparsified models to reduce compute and accelerate CPU inference to GPU performance levels.

As mentioned, the process of sparsifying models adds new hyperpamaters that need to be tuned.
By leveraging sparse transfer learning from pre-sparsified models, you can ignore these steps.
The [SparseZoo](../../products/sparsezoo) contains pre-sparsified models that are ready for transfer learning including the [sparsification recipes](../../user-guide/recipes) used to preserve the sparse architecture on new datasets.
You can identify and reference any model from the SparseZoo through [SparseZoo stubs](../../products/sparsezoo/stubs), and these stubs are found throughout the documentation in addition to the model pages on the [SparseZoo Website](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com).

## Example Use Cases

The docs below walk through use-cases leveraging SparseZoo stubs for sparse transfer learning.

- [Transfer a Sparse, NLP Model to Sentiment Analysis](./sentiment-analysis)
- [Transfer a Sparse Object Detection Model](./object-detection)

## Other Use Cases

For other use cases and models, visit the [SparseZoo Website](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com) to find one that works for you.
