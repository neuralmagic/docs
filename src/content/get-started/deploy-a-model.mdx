# Deploy a Model on CPUs with DeepSparse

This section how to benchmark performance and deploy a model with DeepSparse. 

## Inference APIs

DeepSparse contains two main APIs for interacting with DeepSparse:
- **Pipelines** are the default interface for interacting with DeepSparse. Pipelines wrap inference execution with pre-processing
and post-processing, enabling you to pass raw input and recieve post-processed predictions.

- **Server** wraps a REST Server around DeepSparse Pipelines using FastAPI. This enables you to easily stand up a model service
with all of the functionality and performance of DeepSparse Pipelines.
Pipelines and Server

## Use Cases

The DeepSparse API is organized around use cases in the NLP and CV domains. For use cases with out-of-the-box support,
DeepSparse has pre-made inference Pipelines available that you can leverage for inference. For all other use cases,
DeepSparse is extensible, enabling you to create custom Pipelines to address almost any use case.
