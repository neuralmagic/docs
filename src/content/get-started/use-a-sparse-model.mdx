# Use a Sparse Model

[Sparsification techniques](../../user-guide/sparsification) enable the removal of redundant information from over-parameterized neural networks while retaining the original accuracy.
These sparsified models are smaller and can be deployed for cheaper and faster inferences.
The [DeepSparse Engine](../../products/deepsparse), specifically, leverages the sparsified models to reduce compute and accelerate CPU inference to GPU performance levels.

The process of sparsifying models involves new concepts and adjustments to models and pipelines that may take some time to set up.
For this reason and more, the [SparseZoo](../../products/sparsezoo) contains pre-sparsified models that are ready for testing and deployment in addition to the [sparsification recipes](../../user-guide/recipes) used to create them.

**SparseZoo stubs** enable you to reference any model on the SparseZoo in a convenient and identifiable way.
SparseZoo stubs are found throughout the documentation for the DeepSparse Platform in addition to the model pages on the [SparseZoo Website](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com).

## Example Use Cases

The docs below walk through use-cases leveraging SparseZoo stubs for [deployment](../../use-cases/deploying-with-deepsparse) and [benchmarking](../../user-guide/benchmark).

- [Use a Sparse Sentiment Analysis Model](./sentiment-analysis)
- [Use a Sparse Object Detection Model](./object-detection)

## Other Use Cases

For other use cases and models, visit the [SparseZoo Website](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com) to find one that works for you.
