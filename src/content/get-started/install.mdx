# Installation

The Neural Magic Platform contains several products: DeepSparse (available in two editions, Community and Enterprise), SparseML, and SparseZoo.

Each package is installed with [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/neuralmagic/). It is recommended to install in 
a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to encapsulate your local environment.

## Installing the Neural Magic Platform

To begin using the Neural Magic Platform, run the following command, which installs standard setups for deployment with [DeepSparse](../../products/deepsparse) and model training/optimization with [SparseML](../../products/sparseml):

```bash
pip install deepsparse[server] sparseml[torch,torchvision]
```

Now, you are ready to install one of the Neural Magic products.
