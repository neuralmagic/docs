# Installation

The Neural Magic Platform is made up of core libraries that are available as Python APIs and CLIs.
All Python APIs and CLIs are installed through pip utilizing [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/neuralmagic/).
We recommend you install in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to encapsulate your local environment.

## Installing the Neural Magic Platform

To begin using the Neural Magic Platform, run the following command, which installs standard setups for deployment with [DeepSparse](../../products/deepsparse) and model training/optimization with [SparseML](../../products/sparseml):

```bash
pip install deepsparse[server] sparseml[torch,torchvision]
```

Now, you are ready to install one of the Neural Magic products.
