# DeepSparse Enterprise Edition Installation

The [DeepSparse Engine](/products/deepsparse-ent) enables GPU-class performance on CPUs, leveraging sparsity within models to reduce FLOPs and the unique cache hierarchy on CPUs to reduce memory movement.
The engine accepts models in the open-source [ONNX format](https://onnx.ai/), which are easily created from PyTorch and TensorFlow models.

Currently, DeepSparse is tested on Python 3.7-3.10, ONNX 1.5.0-1.10.1, ONNX opset version 11+ and is [manylinux compliant](https://peps.python.org/pep-0513/).
It is limited to Linux systems running on x86 CPU architectures.

The DeepSparse Engine is available in two editions:
1. [**The Community Edition**](/products/deepsparse) is open-source and free for evaluation, research, and non-production use with our [Engine Community License](https://neuralmagic.com/legal/engine-license-agreement/).
2. [**The Enterprise Edition**](/products/deepsparse-ent) requires a Trial License or [can be fully licensed](https://neuralmagic.com/legal/master-software-license-and-service-agreement/) for production, commercial applications.

## General Install

Use the following command to install with pip:

```bash
pip install deepsparse-ent
```

## Server Install

The [DeepSparse Server](/use-cases/deploying-deepsparse/deepsparse-server) allows you to serve models and pipelines through an HTTP interface using the deepsparse.server CLI.
To install, use the following extra option:

```bash
pip install deepsparse-ent[server]
```

## YOLO Install

The [Ultralytics YOLOv5](/use-cases/object-detection/deploying) models require extra dependencies for deployment.
To use YOLO models, install with the following extra option:

```bash
pip install deepsparse-ent[yolo]         # just yolo requirements
pip install deepsparse-ent[yolo,server] # both yolo + server requirements
```
