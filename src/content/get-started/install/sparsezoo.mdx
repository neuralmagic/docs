# SparseZoo Installation

The [SparseZoo](/products/sparsezoo) stores presparsified models and sparsification recipes so you can easily apply them to your data.
This installs the Python API and CLIs for downloading models and recipes from the [SparseZoo UI](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/).

Note that the SparseZoo package is automatically installed with both SparseML and DeepSparse.

Currently, the SparseZoo Python APIs and CLIs are tested on Python 3.7-3.9 and are limited to [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) and [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/mac/) systems.

## General Install

Use the following command to install with pip:

```bash
pip install sparsezoo
```
