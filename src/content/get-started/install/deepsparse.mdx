# DeepSparse Engine Installation

The [DeepSparse Engine](../../products/deepsparse) enables GPU-class performance on CPUs for neural network deployments exported to the [ONNX model format](https://onnx.ai/).
It leverages sparsity within models to reduce compute and the unique cache hierarchy on CPUs to reduce memory movement.

Currently, DeepSparse is tested on Python 3.6-3.9, ONNX 1.5.0-1.10.1, ONNX opset version 11+ and is [manylinux compliant](https://peps.python.org/pep-0513/).
It is limited to [Linux systems](https://www.linux.org/) running on [X86 CPU architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86).

## General Install

Use the following command to install with pip:

```bash
pip install deepsparse
```

## Server Install

The [DeepSparse Server](../../use-cases/deploying-with-deepsparse/deepsparse-server) allows you to serve models and pipelines through an HTTP interface using the deepsparse.server CLI.
To install, use the following extra option:

```bash
pip install deepsparse[server]
```

## YOLO Install

The [Ultralytics YOLOv5](../../use-cases/ultralytics-yolov5) models require extra dependencies for deployment.
To use YOLO models, install with the following extra option:

```bash
pip install deepsparse[yolo]
```
