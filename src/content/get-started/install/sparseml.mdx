# SparseML Installation

[SparseML](/products/sparseml) leverages [recipes](/user-guide/what-are-recipes) to allow model [sparsification](/user-guide/what-is-sparsification) with only a few lines of code in most pipelines.
It supports applying state-of-the-art sparsification algorithms such as pruning and quantization to any neural network.

Currently, SparseML is tested on Python 3.6-3.9 and is limited to [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) and [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/mac/) systems.

## General Install

Use the following command to install with pip:

```bash
pip install sparseml
```

## PyTorch Install

SparseML supports integrations with PyTorch versions >=1.1.0 and <=1.9.0.
Later PyTorch versions are untested and have a known issue for exporting quantized models to ONNX graphs.
To install, use the following extra option:

```bash
pip install sparseml[torch]
```

To install torchvision as well, use the following extra options:

```bash
pip install sparseml[torch,torchvision]
```

## Keras Install

SparseML supports integrations with Keras versions ~=2.2.0.
Later Keras versions are untested and have known issues with exporting to ONNX.
To install, use the following extra option:

```bash
pip install sparseml[tf_keras]
```

## TensorFlow Install

SparseML supports integrations with TensorFlow versions >=1.8.0 and <=1.15.3.
Note, TensorFlow V1 is no longer being built for newer operating systems such as Ubuntu 20.04.
Therefore, SparseML with TensorFlow V1 is unsupported on these operating systems as well.
To install, use the following extra option:

```bash
pip install sparseml[tf_v1]
```

To install a GPU compatible version, use the following extra option:

```bash
pip install sparseml[tf_v1_gpu]
```

Depending on your device and CUDA version, you may need to install additional dependencies for using TensorFlow V1 with GPU operations.
You can find these steps [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#older_versions_of_tensorflow)
