# Creating Sparsification Recipes

All SparseML Sparsification APIs are designed to work with recipes.
The files encode the instructions needed for modifying the model and/or training process as a list of modifiers.
Example modifiers can be anything from setting the learning rate for the optimizer to gradual magnitude pruning.
The files are written in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) and stored in YAML or
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files using
[YAML front matter.](https://assemble.io/docs/YAML-front-matter.html)
The rest of the SparseML system is coded to parse the recipe files into a native format for the desired framework,
and apply the modifications to the model and training pipeline.

In a recipe, modifiers must be written in a list that includes "modifiers" in its name.

The easiest ways to get or create recipes are by either using the pre-configured recipes in [SparseZoo](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsezoo) or using [Sparsify's](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsify) automatic creation.
Especially for users performing sparse transfer learning from our pre-sparsified models in the SparseZoo, we highly recommend using the
pre-made transfer learning recipes found on SparseZoo. However, power users may be inclined to create their recipes to enable more
fine-grained control or add custom modifiers when sparsifying a new model from scratch.


A sample recipe for pruning a model generally looks like the following:
```yaml
version: 0.1.0
modifiers:
    - !EpochRangeModifier
        start_epoch: 0.0
        end_epoch: 70.0

    - !LearningRateModifier
        start_epoch: 0
        end_epoch: -1.0
        update_frequency: -1.0
        init_lr: 0.005
        lr_class: MultiStepLR
        lr_kwargs: {'milestones': [43, 60], 'gamma': 0.1}

    - !GMPruningModifier
        start_epoch: 0
        end_epoch: 40
        update_frequency: 1.0
        init_sparsity: 0.05
        final_sparsity: 0.85
        mask_type: unstructured
        params: ['sections.0.0.conv1.weight', 'sections.0.0.conv2.weight', 'sections.0.0.conv3.weight']
```

## Modifiers Introduction

Recipes can contain multiple modifiers, each modifying a portion of the training process in a different way.
In general, each modifier will have a start and end epoch for when the modifier should be active.
The modifiers will start at `start_epoch` and run until `end_epoch`.
Note that it does not run *through* `end_epoch`.
Additionally, all epoch values support decimal values such that they can be started anywhere within an epoch.
For example, `start_epoch: 2.5` will start in the middle of the second training epoch.

The most commonly used modifiers are enumerated as subsections below.

## Training Epoch Modifiers

The `EpochRangeModifier` controls the range of epochs for training a model.
Each supported ML framework has an implementation to enable easily retrieving this number of epochs.
Note that this is not a hard rule and, if other modifiers have a larger `end_epoch` or smaller `start_epoch`,
those values will be used instead.

The only parameters that can be controlled for `EpochRangeModifier` are the `start_epoch` and `end_epoch`.
Both parameters are required:

- `start_epoch` indicates the start range for the epoch (0 indexed).
- `end_epoch` indicates the end range for the epoch.

For example:

 ```yaml
     - !EpochRangeModifier
        start_epoch: 0.0
        end_epoch: 25.0
 ```

## Pruning Modifiers

The pruning modifiers handle [pruning](https://neuralmagic.com/blog/pruning-overview/)
the specified layer(s) in a given model.

### ConstantPruningModifier

The `ConstantPruningModifier` enforces the sparsity structure and level for an already pruned layer(s) in a model.
The modifier is generally used for transfer learning from an already pruned model or
to enforce sparsity while quantizing.
The weights remain trainable in this setup; however, the sparsity is unchanged.

The required parameter is:
- `params`indicates the parameters in the model to prune.
This can be set to a string containing `__ALL__` to prune all parameters, a list to specify the targeted parameters,
or regex patterns prefixed by 're:' of parameter name patterns to match.
For example: `['blocks.1.conv']` for PyTorch and `['mnist_net/blocks/conv0/conv']` for TensorFlow.
Regex can also be used to match all conv params: `['re:.*conv']` for PyTorch and `['re:.*/conv']` for TensorFlow.

For example:

```yaml
    - !ConstantPruningModifier
        params: __ALL__
```

#### GMPruningModifier

The `GMPruningModifier` prunes the parameter(s) in a model to a
target sparsity (percentage of 0s for a layer's parameter/variable)
using [gradual magnitude pruning.](https://neuralmagic.com/blog/pruning-gmp/)
This is done gradually from an initial to final sparsity (`init_sparsity`, `final_sparsity`)
over a range of epochs (`start_epoch`, `end_epoch`) and updated at a specific interval defined by the `update_frequency`.
For example, using the following settings:

`start_epoch: 0`, `end_epoch: 5`, `update_frequency: 1`,
`init_sparsity: 0.05`, `final_sparsity: 0.8` 

will do the following.
- At epoch 0, set the sparsity for the specified param(s) to 5%
- Once every epoch, gradually increase the sparsity toward 80%
- By the start of epoch 5, stop pruning and set the final sparsity for the specified parameter(s) to 80%

The required parameters are:

- `params` indicates the parameters in the model to prune.
This can be set to a string containing `__ALL__` to prune all parameters, a list to specify the targeted parameters,
or regex patterns prefixed by 're:' of parameter name patterns to match.
For example: `['blocks.1.conv']` for PyTorch and `['mnist_net/blocks/conv0/conv']` for TensorFlow.
Regex can also be used to match all conv params: `['re:.*conv']` for PyTorch and `['re:.*/conv']` for TensorFlow.
- `init_sparsity` is the decimal value for the initial sparsity with which to start pruning.
`start_epoch` will set the sparsity for the parameter/variable to this value.
Generally, this is kept at 0.05 (5%).
- `final_sparsity` is the decimal value for the final sparsity with which to end pruning.
By the start of `end_epoch` will set the sparsity for the parameter/variable to this value.
Generally, this is kept in a range from 0.6 to 0.95, depending on the model and layer.
Anything less than 0.4 is not useful for performance.
- `start_epoch` sets the epoch at which to start the pruning (0 indexed).
This supports floating point values to enable starting pruning between epochs.
 - `end_epoch` sets the epoch before which to stop pruning.
This supports floating point values to enable stopping pruning between epochs.
 - `update_frequency` is the number of epochs/fractions of an epoch between each pruning step.
It supports floating point values to enable updating inside of epochs.
Generally, this is set to update once per epoch (`1.0`).
However, if the loss for the model recovers quickly, it should be set to a lesser value.
For example, set it to `0.5` for once every half epoch (twice per epoch).

For example:

```yaml
    - !GMPruningModifier
        params: ['blocks.1.conv']
        init_sparsity: 0.05
        final_sparsity: 0.8
        start_epoch: 5.0
        end_epoch: 20.0
        update_frequency: 1.0
```

### Quantization Modifiers

The `QuantizationModifier` sets the model to run with
[quantization-aware training (QAT).](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/quantization.html)
QAT emulates the precision loss of int8 quantization during training so weights can be
learned to limit any accuracy loss from quantization.
Once the `QuantizationModifier` is enabled, it cannot be disabled (no `end_epoch`).
Quantization zero points are set to be asymmetric for activations and symmetric for weights.
Currently, quantization modifiers are available only in PyTorch.

Notes:
- ONNX exports of PyTorch QAT models will be QAT models themselves (emulated quantization).
To convert your QAT ONNX model to a fully quantizerd model, use
the script `scripts/pytorch/model_quantize_qat_export.py` or the function
`neuralmagicML.pytorch.quantization.quantize_qat_export`.
- If performing QAT on a sparse model, you must preserve sparsity during QAT by
applying a `ConstantPruningModifier` or have already used a `GMPruningModifier` with
`leave_enabled` set to True.

The required parameter is:

- `start_epoch` sets the epoch to start QAT. This supports floating-point values to enable
starting pruning between epochs.

For example:

```yaml
    - !QuantizationModifier
        start_epoch: 0.0
```

### Learning Rate Modifiers

The learning rate modifiers set the learning rate (LR) for an optimizer during training.
If you are using an Adam optimizer, then generally, these are not useful.
If you are using a standard stochastic gradient descent optimizer, these give a convenient way to control the LR.

#### SetLearningRateModifier

The `SetLearningRateModifier` sets the LR for the optimizer to a specific value at a specific point
in the training process.

Required parameters are:

- `start_epoch` is the epoch in the training process to set the `learning_rate` value for the optimizer.
This supports floating point values to enable setting the LR between epochs.
- `learning_rate` is the floating-point value to set as the LR for the optimizer at `start_epoch`.

For example:

```yaml
    - !SetLearningRateModifier
        start_epoch: 5.0
        learning_rate: 0.1
```

#### LearningRateModifier

The `LearningRateModifier` sets schedules for controlling the LR for an optimizer during training.
If you are using an Adam optimizer, then generally, these are not useful.
If you are using a standard stochastic gradient descent optimizer, these give a convenient way to control the LR.
Provided schedules from which to choose are:

- `ExponentialLR` multiplies the LR by a `gamma` value every epoch.
To use this, `lr_kwargs` should be set to a dictionary containing `gamma`.
For example: `{'gamma': 0.9}`
- `StepLR` multiplies the LR by a `gamma` value after a certain epoch period defined by `step`.
To use this, `lr_kwargs` must be set to a dictionary containing `gamma` and `step_size`.
For example: `{'gamma': 0.9, 'step_size': 2.0}`
- `MultiStepLR` multiplies the LR by a `gamma` value at specific epoch points defined by `milestones`.
To use this, `lr_kwargs` must be set to a dictionary containing `gamma` and `milestones`.
For example: `{'gamma': 0.9, 'milestones': [2.0, 5.5, 10.0]}`

Required parameters are:

- `start_epoch` sets the epoch at which to start modifying the LR (0 indexed).
This supports floating point values to enable starting pruning between epochs.
- `end_epoch` sets the epoch before which to stop modifying the LR.
This supports floating point values to enable stopping pruning between epochs.
- `lr_class` is the LR class to use, one of [`ExponentialLR`, `StepLR`, `MultiStepLR`].
- `lr_kwargs` is the named argument for the `lr_class`.
- `init_lr` [Optional] is the initial LR to set at `start_epoch` and to use for creating the schedules.
If not given, the optimizer's current LR will be used at startup.

For example:

 ```yaml
     - !LearningRateModifier
        start_epoch: 0.0
        end_epoch: 25.0
        lr_class: MultiStepLR
        lr_kwargs:
            gamma: 0.9
            milestones: [2.0, 5.5, 10.0]
        init_lr: 0.1
 ```

### Params/Variables Modifiers

#### TrainableParamsModifier

The `TrainableParamsModifier` controls the parameters that are marked as trainable for the current optimizer.
This is generally useful when transfer learning to easily mark which parameters should or should not be frozen/trained.

The required parameter is:

- `params` indicates the names of parameters to mark as trainable or not.
This can be set to a string containing `__ALL__` to mark all parameters, a list to specify the targeted parameters,
or regex patterns prefixed by 're:' of parameter name patterns to match.
For example: `['blocks.1.conv']` for PyTorch and `['mnist_net/blocks/conv0/conv']` for TensorFlow.
Regex can also be used to match all conv params: `['re:.*conv']` for PyTorch and `['re:.*/conv']` for TensorFlow.

For example:

```yaml
    - !TrainableParamsModifier
      params: __ALL__
```

### Optimizer Modifiers

#### SetWeightDecayModifier

The `SetWeightDecayModifier` sets the weight decay (L2 penalty) for the optimizer to a
specific value at a specific point in the training process.

Required parameters are:

- `start_epoch` is the epoch in the training process to set the `weight_decay` value for the
optimizer. This supports floating point values to enable setting the weight decay
between epochs.
- `weight_decay` is the floating point value to set as the weight decay for the optimizer
at `start_epoch`.

For example:

```yaml
    - !SetWeightDecayModifier
        start_epoch: 5.0
        weight_decay: 0.0
```
