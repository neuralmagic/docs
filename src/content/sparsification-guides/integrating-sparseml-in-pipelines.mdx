# Integrating SparseML in Pipelines

SparseML enables easy integration in custom training pipelines. This flexibility enables easy sparsification for any neural network architecture for custom models and use cases. Once SparseML is installed, the necessary code can be plugged into most PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow training pipelines with only a few lines of code. The pseudocode below will work for both sparse transfer learning and sparsifying from scratch, simply by passing the appropriate recipe.
