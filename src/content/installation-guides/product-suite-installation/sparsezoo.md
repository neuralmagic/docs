# SparseZoo

The SparseZoo repository is tested on Python 3.8-3.10, and Linux/Debian systems. It is recommended to install in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to keep your system in order.

## Installation

The SparseZoo of pre-sparsified models and recipes is automatically installed with both SparseML and DeepSparse. However, if the need arises, you can re-install SparseZoo with PyPI:

```bash
pip install sparsezoo
```
