# Sparsify

## Requirements

Sparsify requires a GPU with CUDA + CuDNN in order to sparsify neural networks. We recommend you use a Linux system with a GPU that has a minimum of 16GB of GPU memory, 128GB of RAM, 4 CPU cores, and is CUDA-enabled. If you are sparsifying a very large model, you may need more RAM than the recommended 128GB. If you encounter issues setting up your environment, [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/issues).

## Installation

Install and set up Sparsify to accelerate inference without sacrificing accuracy by applying state-of-the-art pruning, quantization, and distillation algorithms to neural networks with a simple web application and one-command API calls. Sparsify installation and setup involves three steps:

1. Creating an account
2. Installing Sparsify
3. Logging in With CLI

Each step is described below.

### Creating an Account

An account is required to manage your experiments and API keys. Creating an account is a simple and free one-time process. (If you already have a Neural Magic Account, [sign in](https://account.neuralmagic.com/signin) with your email.)

Visit [Neural Magic's Web App Platform](https://account.neuralmagic.com/signup) and create an account by entering your email, unique password, your name, and a user name.

### Installing Sparsify

Install Sparsify on your training hardware with PyPI. It is advised to create a [fresh virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to avoid dependency issues.

```bash
pip install sparsify-nightly
```

### Logging in With CLI

With Sparsify installed on your training hardware:
1. Authorize the local CLI to access your account by running the sparsify.login command and providing your API key.
2. Locate your API key on the homepage of the [Sparsify Cloud](https://apps.neuralmagic.com/sparsify) under the 'Get set up' modal, and copy the command or the API key itself.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
sparsify.login API_KEY
```
