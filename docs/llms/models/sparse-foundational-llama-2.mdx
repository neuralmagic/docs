# Sparse Foundational Llama 2 Models

Neural Magic and Cerebras partnered to offer a range of expertly optimized Llama 2-based Large Language Models (LLMs) that have been sparsified for superior performance and reduced footprint.
These models are carefully selected and rigorously tested, ensuring exceptional quality and seamless deployment.

## Why Choose Sparse Llama 2 Models?

- *Accelerated Inference*: Sparse Llama 2 models offer significant speed improvements, enabling faster responses and real-time applications.
- *Reduced Resource Requirements*: Sparsification decreases the model's size, allowing deployment on edge devices or in environments with limited compute power.
- *Cost-Effectiveness*: Lower compute requirements translate to reduced operational costs for your LLM-based applications.
