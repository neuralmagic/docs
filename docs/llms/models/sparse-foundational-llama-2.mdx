# Sparse Foundational Llama 2 Models

Neural Magic offers a range of expertly optimized Llama 2-based Large Language Models (LLMs) that have been sparsified for superior performance and reduced footprint.
These models are carefully selected and rigorously tested, ensuring exceptional quality and seamless deployment.

## Why Choose Sparse Llama 2 Models?

- Accelerated Inference: Sparse Llama 2 models offer significant speed improvements, enabling faster responses and real-time applications.
- Reduced Resource Requirements: Sparsification decreases the model's size, allowing deployment on edge devices or in environments with limited compute power.
- Cost-Effectiveness: Lower compute requirements translate to reduced operational costs for your LLM-based applications.
