# Sparse LLMs

Neural Magic offers a wide range of optimized Large Language Models (LLMs) ready for efficient inference or further tuning on your datasets.
This guide will help you explore and leverage models from our Hugging Face Hub as well as our SparseZoo.

## Featured Model Collections

Neural Magic offers expertly curated collections of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) that have been rigorously sparsified for optimal inference performance.
Dive deeper into these collections and explore usage guides for readily optimized models:

## Hugging Face Hub Models

The Hugging Face Hub offers a vast repository of LLMs that are compatible with DeepSparse.
While these models may not have undergone the same extensive quality assurance as SparseZoo models, they often allow for faster deployment into production environments.
It's important to always evaluate Hugging Face Hub models to ensure their results meet your quality expectations.

Utilize the following links to streamline your discovery of LLMs on our Hugging Face Hub:
