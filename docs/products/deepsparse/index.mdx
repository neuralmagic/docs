# DeepSparse

Neural Magic's DeepSparse is a CPU runtime that takes advantage of sparsity within neural networks to reduce compute. 

Supporting various LLMs, computer vision, and NLP models, DeepSparse integrates into popular deep learning libraries, such as Hugging Face and Ultralytics, allowing you to leverage DeepSparse for loading and deploying sparse models with ONNX. ONNX gives the flexibility to serve your model in a framework-agnostic environment. Coupled with [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml), our optimization library for pruning and quantizing your models, DeepSparse delivers exceptional inference performance on CPU hardware.

## DeepSparse Prerequisites
[Review deployment, training, and software requirements](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/get-started/install/) to confirm DeepSparse is compatible with your use case.

## Editions and Licenses
DeepSparse is available in two editions and is licensed accordingly for end users:

- **DeepSparse Community** is licensed under the [Neural Magic DeepSparse Community License](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/blob/main/LICENSE). 

    - See [DeepSparse Community Installation](/get-started/install/deepsparse#community-installation) for further installation options.

- **DeepSparse Enterprise** requires a [Trial License](https://neuralmagic.com/deepsparse-engine-free-trial) or [can be fully licensed](https://neuralmagic.com/legal/master-software-license-and-service-agreement/) for production, commercial applications. To learn more about DeepSparse Enterprise pricing, [contact our Sales team](https://neuralmagic.com/contact) to discuss your use case further for a custom quote.

    - See [DeepSparse Enterprise Installation](/get-started/install/deepsparse#enterprise-installation) for further installation options, including license activation.
