## Selecting a Model

Start by choosing the ideal model for your project:

- <b>Neural Magic's Model Repositories:</b> Discover a vast selection of pre-sparsified models across popular use cases in our [SparseZoo](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/neuralmagic) repositories. These models are ready for immediate, high-performance deployment.
- <b>Custom Models:</b> Easily integrate your PyTorch or ONNX models into Neural Magic's workflow, applying cutting-edge optimization and deployment techniques tailored to your specific needs.

## Optimizing a Model

Achieve unmatched model efficiency with Neural Magic's SparseML. This powerful toolkit leverages state-of-the-art research to streamline your optimization process:

- <b>Advanced Sparsification:</b> Employ sophisticated pruning and quantization strategies to shrink model size and boost inference speed.
- <b>User-Friendly Approach:</b>  SparseML is intuitive and accessible, empowering users at all levels to apply advanced optimization techniques effortlessly.


## Deploying a Model

Deploy your optimized model with exceptional performance on CPUs using Neural Magic's DeepSparse:

- <b>CPU-Optimized Performance:</b> DeepSparse harnesses the potential of sparsity to deliver GPU-level performance on commodity CPUs, maximizing hardware utilization.
- <b>Seamless Integration:</b> Deploy easily, as DeepSparse smoothly integrates into your existing applications, minimizing development overhead.
